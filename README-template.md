# Frontend Mentor - Meet Landing Page Solution

This is my solution for the **Meet Landing Page** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).  
The goal of this project was to build a responsive landing page that matches the provided design as closely as possible.

## üß† Overview

I built this project using **HTML** and **SCSS**.  
It was a great exercise in managing responsive layouts and refining typography using modern CSS features like `clamp()`.  
Throughout the process, I learned how to organize media queries more efficiently and handle layout adjustments between mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## üß© Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (variables, mixins, and functions)
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- `clamp()` for fluid typography
- Mobile-first workflow
- Perfect Pixel method for alignment checking

## üí° What I learned

While coding, I realized the importance of **analyzing all breakpoints first** before writing the initial structure.  
I added several class names later during development, which worked fine but made me think more about planning ahead.

I also experimented with `clamp()` for responsive font sizes.  
Some text elements didn‚Äôt scale exactly as I expected, so I decided to use `rem()` for fixed parts and `clamp()` only where fluid resizing felt natural.  
This experience helped me understand the practical balance between flexibility and precision.

I used SCSS variables for color management, and next time, I‚Äôd like to take it further by using variables for font sizes and spacing as well.

## üöÄ Next steps

- Create more mixins to reduce repetition
- Improve font scaling with a better system of variables
- Plan breakpoints more clearly before writing HTML
